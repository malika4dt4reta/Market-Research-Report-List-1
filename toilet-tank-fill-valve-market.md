<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Toilet Tank Fill Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Float Ball</li><li>Float Cup</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The toilet tank fill valve market comprises two primary types: the float ball and the float cup. The float ball, an older design, uses a large buoyant ball attached to an arm to regulate water flow. When the tank fills, the ball rises, shutting off the valve. In contrast, the float cup design employs a smaller float that moves along the valve's shaft, allowing for more precise filling and often quieter operation. Both types are essential for efficient toilet functioning and water conservation.</p></p>
