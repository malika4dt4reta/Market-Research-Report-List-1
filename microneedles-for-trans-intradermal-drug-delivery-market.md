<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microneedles for Trans / Intradermal Drug Delivery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Microneedles</li><li>Hollow Microneedles</li><li>Dissolvable Microneedles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The microneedles market for transdermal and intradermal drug delivery comprises three primary types: solid, hollow, and dissolvable microneedles. Solid microneedles penetrate the skin to create microchannels for drug diffusion but require a separate application of the therapeutic agent. Hollow microneedles allow for the direct infusion of liquid drugs through a reservoir. Dissolvable microneedles, made from biocompatible polymers, dissolve upon application, releasing the drug directly into the skin. Each type offers unique advantages for efficient and painless drug delivery.</p></p>
